# Hey there, I’m Jonathan Ryan 👋

I’m an **analytical problem solver** and **Project Management Office (PMO) Executive** with a strong focus on **governance, audit, and decision support**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **data, structure, and strategy** — breaking down complex operational problems and turning them into clear, actionable insights.

While I use technology as an enabler, my core strength lies in **analytical thinking, systems design, and problem decomposition** rather than tools alone.

- Design **KPIs and metrics** that actually drive the right behaviour  
- Apply **data-driven analysis** to governance, quality, and delivery challenges
